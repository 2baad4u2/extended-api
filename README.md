## Contribution Guidelines
Contributions from the community are what is responsible for shaping this repository. With that being said, there are some guidelines that should be followed to keep this repository in a nice state.


Prior to submission, you should ensure that what you have doesn't already exist. Check existing pull requests, both open and closed.


### Standards
* Follow Java code conventions, including formatting

* Packages must start with `org.rspeer.runetek.api`

* Class names must be clear and must not collide with existing classes in the RSPeer core API. As an example, inventory extensions would be named ExInventory instead of Inventory

* Try to keep method bodies at a maximum of 20 lines unless deemed appropriate
